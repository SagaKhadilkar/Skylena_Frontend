        <h1>Cloud-Native Application Development</h1>
        <p>Cloud-native application development is a modern approach to building and deploying applications that leverage the scalability, flexibility, and reliability of cloud computing. This business module focuses on incorporating various technologies
            and practices such as message queues, microservices, monitoring, log analytics, NoSQL, RDBMS, in-memory databases, time-series databases, AI/ML, and automation to enable efficient and robust cloud-native application development.</p>

        <p>The primary objectives of this business module are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Enable efficient communication and scalability through the use of message queues.</li>
            <li>Facilitate modular and loosely coupled architectures with microservices.</li>
            <li>Ensure real-time monitoring and analysis of application logs through log analytics.</li>
            <li>Utilize NoSQL databases for flexible and scalable data storage.</li>
            <li>Leverage RDBMS for structured and relational data requirements.</li>
            <li>Utilize in-memory databases for high-performance data access.</li>
            <li>Implement time-series databases for efficient storage and analysis of time-based data.</li>
            <li>Incorporate AI/ML capabilities to enhance application intelligence.</li>
            <li>Automate deployment, testing, and scaling processes to streamline application development.</li>
